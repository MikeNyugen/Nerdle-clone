# Project Code

This package contains the resources needed to run the CS5031 Numble P2 Application.

It contains a RESTful API and an underlying model of the Numble game. There is also a GUI for the game,
and the game can be run using "curl".

There are also appropriate test classes within the test folder.

The game can be run from the command line using the gradle bootRun command.

The game has four different modes:
Easy: The result is displayed.
Medium: The result is not displayed.
Hard: The result is displayed and the equation guess should evaluate to the result.
Super-Hard: The result is not displayed. The equation guesses be valid.
